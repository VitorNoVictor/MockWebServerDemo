# MockWebServerDemo

A sample Android app which shows how to integrate and use [MockWebServer](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver) and [RESTMock](https://github.com/andrzejchm/RESTMock) for instrumentation tests. The main idea for this project was to create and test common scenarios for every app that consumes an HTTP API, like successful requests, server errors, and timeouts.

Packages, classes, and methods are organized in a didactic way to focus on the relationship between components and its responsibilities.
